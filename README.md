# Introduction
Air quality is a measure of the amount of pollutants in the air. Air pollution is a major environmental issue that affects the health of millions of people worldwide. In this document, we will discuss the causes and effects of air pollution and how it has changed over time.

This README will explain more about:
- How air quality has changed over time
- What air pollution actually is
- Why air pollution is an issue.

# Air Quality Over Time
Air quality has changed significantly over the past few decades. The burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and transportation are some of the main sources of air pollution. The increase in air pollution has led to a rise in respiratory diseases, heart disease, and other health problems. The following table shows the changes in air quality over the past few decades:

Year |	Air Quality Index
--- | ---
1980 |	50
1990 |	75
2000 |	100
2010 |	125
2020 |	150

# What is Air Pollution?
Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air. These substances can come from natural sources such as dust and wildfires, or human-made sources such as factories and cars. The most common types of air pollutants include particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and ozone.

# Why is Air Pollution an Issue?
Air pollution has a significant impact on human health and the environment. Exposure to air pollutants can cause respiratory diseases, heart disease, and other health problems. Air pollution also contributes to climate change, which has far-reaching effects on the environment. The following are some of the ways air pollution affects different aspects of life:

- Health: Air pollution can cause respiratory diseases, heart disease, and other health problems.
- Environment: Air pollution contributes to climate change, which has far-reaching effects on the environment.
- Economy: Air pollution can have a negative impact on the economy by reducing productivity and increasing healthcare costs.

# Conclusion
Air pollution is a major environmental issue that affects the health of millions of people worldwide. In this document, we discussed the causes and effects of air pollution and how it has changed over time. We hope this information has been helpful.
